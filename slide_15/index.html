    <h1>words on a string</h1>
    <p>
      "on a string" refers to the influence and control you, creative and coder,
      have on words. Both on the level of semantics and of forms.
    </p>
   
    <p>
      A <span style="background-color: black; color: white">string</span> is
      also the term computers use when they see words, characters, or
      non-numbers.
    </p>
 
    <p> Computers don't discriminate nor weight words. <a href="../slide_16">Fully yours is the creative privilege</a>.</p>
