    <h1>P5*js</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="https://p5js.org">P5*js</a> is a JavaScript that went to art
      school. It is still good old JavaScript â€” it uses the same syntax and
      language features â€” but it's a tad more creative and functions better for
      artistic purposes such as graphics, animation, and interaction design.
