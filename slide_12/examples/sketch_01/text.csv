# A SCROLL AND A SLUDGE #

## by Leo Scarin ##

the scroll and the sludge are two very weird words
as often happens with words, their meaning has been claimed by digital technology
respectively to explain interactive user behaviours
and to describe consumer content aesthetics.

These words demonstrate digital technology's prerequisite of metaphorical language.

Among other metaphors, digital technology uses:

 🕷 🕷 🕷 🕷 web 🕷 🕷 🕷 🕷 


 ☁ ☁ ☁ ☁ cloud ☁ ☁ ☁ ☁ 


  🐛 🐛 🐛 bug 🐛 🐛 🐛  


  🌳 🌳 🌳 tree 🌳 🌳 🌳  


  🏠 🏠 🏠 window 🏠 🏠 🏠 

and so on and on and on and on and on and on and on
and on and on and on and on and on and on
and on and on and on and on
and on and on
and on

technology turns out to be further than we expect from
"tool-making" 
and closer to


poetry


as in
the making of metaphors
the making of interfaces of thought
the making of meanings

in particular, technology has been unmaking
attention
attention
attention has been fragmented through
technological incentives
to serve economies relying on data growth and collection

the scroll is a form of record-keeping text
the scroll was also editable
ancient Qur'ān manuscripts were scrolls
although usually presented in 'codex'

The Codex was the ancestor of what we call a book, what eventually replaced the scrolls.
